# 🍅 Pomotama

[Pomotama](https://pomotama.netlify.app/) is a Pomodoro timer app inspired by [Pomofocus.io](https://pomofocus.io/), built with React and TypeScript. I love Pomofocus.io so much that I'm basically using it every day while doing tasks. While it's being really helpful to my productivity flow, I feel like I can improve the app to suit my need more. Therefore, I built this side project for both learning purposes and personal usage.

## 📦 Technologies

-   <code>React.js</code>
-   <code>TypeScript</code>
-   <code>Tailwind CSS</code>
-   <code>Testing Library</code>
-   <code>Jotai</code>

## 🤔 How to use a Pomodoro timer?

1. **Add tasks** to work on today
2. **Set estimate pomodoros** (1 = 25min of work) for each task
3. **Select a task** to work on
4. **Start timer** and focus on the task for 25 minutes
5. **Take a break** for 5 minutes when the alarm rings
6. **Iterate** 3-5 until you finish the tasks

> ℹ️ Tip:
> The selected task will update its estimate pomodoro number once the pomodoro timer has finished!
